// Stage one, act one: We begin near our home village, where a village elder tasks our hero with an important mission.
// The nearby capital city has been late collecting taxes, and what is worse, the capital city trade caravan hasn't been seen in weeks.
// You must investigate what is going on, as we are building up a surplus of grains and suffer a dire shortage of textiles.

Kris, as our best scout, you have been selected by the council of elders to investigate what is going on in the Capital. As you know, the trade caravan from the Capital has not been seen in some time. And what is even stranger, is that no Royal Accountants have come to collect taxes for the kingdom recently.
As long as we pay our taxes the King has generously allowed us to govern ourselves, but now the Elders fear something is afoot - we must know! You may seek out Bowie to accompany you to the City, she should be out hunting small game in the woods to the east.

I will not let you down!
