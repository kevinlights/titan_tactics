Oh boy, what a mess. Rolf, my son, I have to tell you something important. You were adopted. No, it's true, stop crying.
The woman you've always known as your mother is a prostitute I hired when I found you in the woods, and she's been taking care of you at an outrageous hourly fee.
So anyway, your brothers and sisters are not your blood, and frankly, I don't even think they like you.
I think it would be best for you if you were to just leave, and don't come back. There's rumors of a  wishing well to the west, maybe you can wish for a family or whatever.

Wait, what?
