Let me just remind you of some stuff. Human enemies can use ether swords, bows or magic wands. You have a sword and I have a bow. Humans with bows can hit you from far away. Each type of unit has its own advantages against the others, causing you to deal or receive more damage to them. Sword beats bow, bow beats magic, and magic beats sword.

You can take cover behind that wall. Long range attacks will be blocked by the object you are hiding behind.
