//after hitting enemy, letâ€™s recruit him

# bowie
Nice! Let's fight now! When your opponents' HP hits 1/3 of its total points, sometimes a new option may appear: RECRUIT. If your opponent's HP reaches 0, they die and disappear instead.
Fight that Archer until he forfeit! After RECRUIT, he will be on your side onwards!
