If you're in a position where attacking is not a good idea, you can open the menu and guard or just end your turn instead.
For now let's focus on attacking though. You remember your rival Lokum, right? It seems he's quite upset he wasn't picked by the council to go to Tyrmyr instead, but he will serve to help us refresh your training!
Just walk up right next to Lokum in order to attack him!
