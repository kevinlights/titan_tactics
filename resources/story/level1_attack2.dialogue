Nice! The damage you dealt will lower your enemies' HP.
If you're in a situation where attacking is not the best idea, you can open the menu and guard instead. By doing so you will adopt a defensive stance and reduce any incoming damage in the following turn. Sometimes defense is the best offense! But for now, just finish Lokum off!
