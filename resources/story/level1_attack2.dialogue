Ow, that really hurts!

Nice! The damage you dealt will lower your enemies' HP.
If you're in a situation where attacking is unwise, you can open the menu and guard instead. By doing so you will adopt a defensive stance and reduce any incoming damage in the following turn. But for now, just finish Lokum off! End your turn first, and attack him again on your next one!
