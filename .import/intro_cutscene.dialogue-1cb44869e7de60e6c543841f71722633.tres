As you know, the trade caravan from the Capital has not been seen in some time. And what is even stranger, is that no Royal Accountants have come to collect taxes for the kingdom recently.
As long as we pay our taxes the King has generously allowed us to govern ourselves, but now the Elders fear something is afoot - we must know! You may seek out Bowie to accompany you to the City, she should be out hunting small game in the woods to the east.
